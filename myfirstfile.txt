For Part 1 & 2:
	Command & Explanation: 
		echo "#Lab-3-CSE-5408" >> README.md 
		git init
		git add README.md
		git commit -m "first commit"
		git branch -M main
		git remote add origin https://github.com/Cindy-Milan/Lab-3-CSE-5408.git
		git push -u origin main
		# Since we needed to add a new responsitory and a new file README.md 
		# this allows us to initialize and start branching and adding files
		# to the respository. we add the first branch "main" which is the main
		# branch we will be editing. the "git remote add origin..." and 
		# "push -u ..." allows us to have remote access to the actual webpage.  

		gitc checkout -b new_branch
		git branch
		touch file
		git add file
		git commit -m "hello"
		git push origin new_branch
		git checkout main
		git branch
		git merge new_branch
		git push
		# after adding the main branch, we are asked to make another branch which
		# i entitled "new_branch". using the "touch" command i made a new file
		# named "file", added the file and added a comment "hello" to the file.
		# I swapped to the main branch using "checkout", and checked using
		# "git branch". Since I added files to the other branch using
		# "git merge new_branch", I i merged the files from that branch to the 
		# main branch, after using "git push" we are able to see the file "file"
		# under "main" along with the other file "README.md"

Part 3:
	Command & Explanation: 
		git clone https://github.com/Juan-Inzunza/CSE408-Example.git
		# This section was different, I made a new folder in my Desktop
		# named "new folder". and opend it with the git terminal, using a 
		# url of another fellow git user, i cloned his folder "CSE 408 Example"
		# using "git clone [url] ". as shown in the screenshot, the folder cloned
		# directly onto the "new folder"
